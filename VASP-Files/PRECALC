# This parameter is used to auto-detect slabs, nanowires, and 
# nanoparticles. If there is a gap (vacuum) that is at least 
# GAPDISTANCE wide in the provided structure, the k-point 
# density in the corresponding direction will be reduced 
# accordingly.  GAPDISTANCE is given in Angstroms.

# Removes symmetry operations from consideration when generating 
# the k-point grid.
# Allowed values: NONE, STRUCTURAL, ALL
# 
# NONE is the default value. The server will try to maximize the
# number of symmetry operations used to reduce the k-point grid 
# in a way that is consistent with the input files for the 
# calculation.
#
# STRUCTURAL removes structural symmetry operations and retains  
# only time-reversal symmetry.  If the calculation input files 
# provided to the server specify that the system does not have 
# time-reversal symmetry, then no symmetry operations will be 
# used to reduce the grid.
# 
# ALL removes both structural and time-reversal symmetry 
# operations.  Symmetry will not be use to reduce the number of 
# k-points in the returned grid.
REMOVE_SYMMETRY = NONE
